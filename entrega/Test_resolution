3) F - The Mbap header is composed of 4 diferent parts , (Transaction id, Protocol identifier, length, UNIT_ID) so the port dos not belong here
 
4) F - The accept() function cant be used to connect to the server , to do that we must use the connect() function.

5) F - Write function is not well defined , if we pretend to write the vector val[10] we must write the funtion like this -> write(s ,val ,sizeof(val))

7) V

8) F - 

9) F - Read -> 125
       Write-> 123

10) F - The MBAP has a fixed size of 7 but the APDU has a variable size so this statment is only half true

11) F - The parameter of transaction identifier must have an incrementing value 

12) V

13) V - correct afirmation because the maximum number of registers to read isss 125 and in the statment its used 400

14) F - is not essencial but helps with organization and coherence between programs 
 
15) V

16) F

17) V

18) V

19) F - MBAPDU in teh example should have a specified structure in relation to number of registers read -> 
        MBAP -> 00:03:00:00:00:05::01
        PDU-> 03:XX:XX:01

20) F - U wont receive a valid response u can get a exception , and the program is forced to terminate
